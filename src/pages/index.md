    title: Why TBD Labs
    content: >
      Like it or not, you are competing with Google and Amazon.


      Aware or not, among the biggest risks looming for your business is a lack
      of access to technology.


      Salaries are up. Available talent is down.


      Over the next 10 years, the gap between the companies who can execute on
      machine learning and those who cannot will widen. Those with the hard
      skills to create and build will be *ever more rarified* and expensive.


      TBD Labs helps your product and engineering team bridge this gap. From
      hands-on development to mentorship, we are here to provide your business
      with the data tools necessary to compete (realistically) with the
      mega-corporations hiring engineers by the dozens, if not 100s!
