    title: Why TBD Labs
    content: >
      Like it or not, you are competing with Google and Amazon.


      Aware or not, among the biggest risks looming for your business is a lack
      of access to technology.


      Salaries are up. Available talent is down.


      Over the next 10 years, the gap between the companies who can execute on
      machine learning and those who cannot will widen. Those with the hard
      skills to create and build will be *ever more rarified* and expensive.


      TBD Labs helps your product and engineering team bridge this gap. From
      hands-on development to mentorship, we are here to provide your business
      with the data tools necessary to compete (realistically) with the
      mega-corporations hiring engineers by the dozens, if not 100s!

          Many very large companies are expending tremendous capital rushing
          into data science and machine learning with little more than a vague
          notion of how to use it. *This is an avoidable waste.*


          TBD Labs takes the time to understand your business, your customers
          and your data to identify the projects apt for machine learning.


          We have the experience to know what is worth pursuing and what is not,
          so that you and your organization make the most of each opportunity.

          TBD Labs always brings the problem back to the dollar cost to the
          business.


          We help define metrics for accurate and unbiased measurement of ROI.
          We provide the structure and processes for assessing projects before
          development begins as well as the tools for post-production ROI.


          ***Our goal is 10x.***


          Be it dollars gained or hours optimized, our goal is a return of 10x
          for each and every project. If it's not a 10x project, it's not worth
          doing.
